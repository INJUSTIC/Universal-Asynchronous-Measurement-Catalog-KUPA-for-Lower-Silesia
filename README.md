# Universal-Asynchronous-Measurement-Catalog-KUPA-for-Lower-Silesia

This project involves deploying sensors for measuring temperature, humidity, and pressure in various locations in Lower Silesia, controlled by a Central Information System. The residents can use an application called KUPA 
to register to specific locations, receive notifications about changes in subscribed sensors, and analyze the data. The application allows for the collection of all data and offers basic analysis options, 
such as calculating averages, minimum, and maximum values.
